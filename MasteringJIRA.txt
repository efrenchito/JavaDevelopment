@Mastering JIRA  -> Gain expertise in tracking project issues and managing them efficiently using JIRA

1. Planning Your JIRA Installation
	Overview
	  Atlassian JIRA is a proprietary issue tracking system. It is used to track bugs, resolve issues, and manage project functions. 
	  There are many such tools available in the market, but the best thing about JIRA is that it can be easily configured and it 
	  offers a wide range of customizations. Out of the box, JIRA offers defect/bug tracking functionalities, but it can also be 
	  customized to act like a helpdesk system, a simple test management suite, or a project management system with end-to-end 
	  traceability.
    Planning the installation
      From the very beginning, start preparing the documents to store all the following information:
      • Number of users:
        ° Are users part of a single team or several teams?
        ° If users are part of several teams working with different groups, then is there a need to limit the visibility of 
          projects within these groups?
      • Number of projects: There is no limit on the number of projects.
      • JIRA server hardware recommendation:
        ° For approximately 50 projects and 100 users,less than 5000 issues—16 GB RAM and a multicore CPU
        ° For approximately 100 projects and 3000 users, less than 100,000 issues—32 GB RAM,
      • Will you need mail notifications in JIRA -> JIRA has the capability to send e-mails to users on various
		events, such as issue creating, updating, and resolving. In order to send
		e-mails, an SMTP server is required. JIRA can also be configured with Google Apps for Work;
	  • Authentication: JIRA has its own internal directory user management system where the information 
	    of a user is stored in an internal database.
	  • Can JIRA be used from multiple locations?:
	  • How many concurrent users will access the system?:
	  • Tentatively, how many issues per project can be stored?:
	  • Tentatively, how many total issues can be stored?:
	  • Will users also upload attachments in their projects?:
	  • How many custom fields do you intend to create?:
	  • Choice of platform and database:
	  • Integration with other tools:
